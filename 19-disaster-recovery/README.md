# Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery (DR) is the ability to restore service after a failure — be it hardware, software, human error, or a regional outage. DR is not backup; backup is one component of DR.

## DR vs High Availability

| Aspect | High Availability | Disaster Recovery |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Goal | Prevent downtime | Recover from failure |
| Scope | Component-level redundancy | Region/site-level failure |
| Response | Automatic (seconds) | Planned procedure (minutes–hours) |
| Example | Multi-AZ RDS failover | Restore to a different AWS region |

## DR Tiers

| Tier | Strategy | RTO | RPO | Cost |
|------|----------|-----|-----|------|
| 1 | Backup & restore | Hours–days | Hours | Lowest |
| 2 | Pilot light | 30–60 min | Minutes | Low |
| 3 | Warm standby | 10–30 min | Seconds–minutes | Medium |
| 4 | Multi-site active-active | Seconds | Near-zero | Highest |
