# DevOps Engineer Roadmap

A DevOps engineer builds the systems that let developers ship faster and safer. The focus is on automation, pipelines, infrastructure as code, and container orchestration.

**Prerequisite:** Cloud Engineer Roadmap Phase 1–2, or equivalent experience.

  ├── Modules: writing and consuming
  └── Workspaces and environment management

Week 12–13: Advanced Terraform
  ├── Terragrunt for DRY configurations
  ├── Testing: Terratest, checkov, tfsec
  ├── Terraform in CI (plan on PR, apply on merge)
  └── Importing existing resources

Week 14: Ansible
  ├── Playbooks, roles, inventory                              → 12-ansible/

  ├── Persistent volumes, storage classes
  ├── Cluster autoscaler, Karpenter
  └── Kubernetes costs with Kubecost
```

**Milestone:** Kubernetes App project: EKS with full production stack.

---

## Phase 5: Observability and Reliability (3–4 weeks)

```
Week 21–22: Observability
  ├── Prometheus metrics + recording rules + alerting          → 15-observability/
