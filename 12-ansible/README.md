# Ansible

Ansible is an agentless configuration management, application deployment, and IT automation tool. It communicates over SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows) and uses YAML-based playbooks.

---

## Why Ansible?

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agentless** | Only requires SSH/Python on managed nodes |
| **Idempotent** | Running playbooks multiple times produces the same result |
| **Human-readable** | YAML playbooks are self-documenting |
| **Batteries included** | 3,000+ built-in modules for packages, files, services, cloud APIs |
| **Extensible** | Custom modules, plugins, and roles via Ansible Galaxy |

## Ansible vs Terraform

| | Terraform | Ansible |
|--|-----------|---------|
| Primary use | Infrastructure provisioning | Configuration management / app deployment |
| State | Stateful (state file) | Stateless (idempotent tasks) |
| Language | HCL | YAML |
| Execution model | Declarative (desired state) | Procedural (ordered tasks) |
| Agentless | Yes | Yes |
| Use together? | ✅ Provision with Terraform → configure with Ansible |

## How Ansible Works

```
Control Node                        Managed Nodes
   │                                      │
   ├── inventory.ini  ──────────────→  [web1, web2, web3]
   ├── playbook.yml   ── SSH/SFTP  →  [db1]
   └── roles/         ──────────────→  [cache1]

Ansible pushes tasks to managed nodes over SSH.
No agent runs on managed nodes — only Python is required.
```

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Inventory** | List of managed hosts, organized into groups |
| **Playbook** | Ordered set of plays (YAML) to run against inventory |
| **Play** | Maps a group of hosts to a set of tasks |
| **Task** | Single unit of work using a module |
| **Module** | Idempotent action: install package, copy file, restart service |
| **Role** | Reusable bundle of tasks, files, templates, and variables |
| **Handler** | Task triggered by `notify` — runs once at end of play |
| **Vault** | Encrypted storage for secrets within playbooks |
| **Fact** | Host metadata gathered automatically (OS, IPs, memory) |
