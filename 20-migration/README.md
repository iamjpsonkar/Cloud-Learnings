# Cloud Migration

Cloud migration is the process of moving workloads from on-premises or one cloud environment to another. The 6Rs framework provides a structured way to decide the right approach for each workload.

## The 6Rs

| Strategy | Description | Effort | Best when |
|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **Retire** | Decommission — application is no longer needed | None | End-of-life apps |
| **Retain** | Keep on-premises for now | None | Not ready to migrate |
| **Rehost** (Lift & Shift) | Move to cloud with no changes | Low | Legacy apps, quick wins |
| **Replatform** (Lift & Reshape) | Minor optimizations without redesign | Medium | Managed DB, containers |
| **Repurchase** | Replace with SaaS | Medium | Commodity software |
| **Refactor** (Re-architect) | Redesign for cloud-native | High | Strategic, long-term |

## Migration Factory Approach

```
Discover → Assess → Plan → Migrate → Optimize → Operate
    │           │       │       │          │          │
  Inventory  6Rs map   Wave   Execute    Cost/      BAU
  TCO calc   TCO       plan   test       perf       handoff
```
