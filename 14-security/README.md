# Cloud Security

Security is not a feature — it is a baseline requirement. This section covers the security controls, tools, and practices that protect cloud infrastructure and applications.

## Security Domains

| Domain | What it covers |
|--------|----------------|
| **Identity & Access** | IAM, least privilege, service accounts, federation |
| **Network Security** | VPCs, firewalls, WAF, DDoS, private endpoints |
| **Secrets Management** | Vaults, rotation, no plaintext secrets |
| **Encryption** | At-rest, in-transit, key management, HSMs |
| **Vulnerability Management** | CVE scanning, patching, SBOM |
| **Application Security** | SAST, DAST, dependency auditing |
| **Threat Modeling** | STRIDE, attack surface, data flow analysis |
| **Compliance** | SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001, CIS |
| **Incident Response** | Detection, containment, eradication |
| **Supply Chain Security** | SLSA, image signing, provenance |

## Shared Responsibility Model (Quick Reference)

| Cloud component | AWS/Azure/GCP responsibility | Your responsibility |
|-----------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Physical hardware | ✅ | |
| Hypervisor / host OS | ✅ | |
| Managed service (RDS, GCS, etc.) | ✅ (service) | Config, data, access |
| VM OS (EC2, Compute Engine) | | ✅ patching, hardening |
| Application code | | ✅ |
| IAM / access policies | | ✅ |
| Data classification | | ✅ |
| Network configuration | Shared | Shared |
