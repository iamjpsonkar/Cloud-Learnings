# Error Budgets

An error budget is the acceptable amount of unreliability for a given period, derived from your SLO. It aligns engineering and operations: when the budget is healthy, move fast; when it's exhausted, stop feature work and fix reliability.

---

## Error Budget Math

```
SLO: 99.9% availability
Error budget: 100% - 99.9% = 0.1%

Over 30 days (2,592,000 seconds):
  Allowed downtime:    2,592,000 × 0.001 = 2,592 seconds ≈ 43 minutes

Over 7 days:
  Allowed downtime:    604,800 × 0.001 = 604 seconds ≈ 10 minutes

For request-based SLOs (1,000 requests/min × 60 min × 24 hr × 30 days = 43.2M requests/month):
  Allowed failures:    43,200,000 × 0.001 = 43,200 failed requests
```

| SLO | Monthly downtime | Weekly downtime |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| 99.0% | 7h 18m | 1h 41m |
| 99.5% | 3h 39m | 50m |
| 99.9% | 43m 48s | 10m 4s |
| 99.95% | 21m 54s | 5m 2s |
| 99.99% | 4m 22s | 1m 0s |

## Burn Rate

Burn rate measures how fast you are consuming your error budget relative to the expected rate.

```
Burn rate = (current error rate) / (error budget rate)

Budget rate for 99.9% SLO = 0.001 (0.1% errors allowed)

If current error rate = 5%:
  Burn rate = 5% / 0.1% = 50x
  At this rate, 30-day budget exhausted in: 30 days / 50 = 14.4 hours
```

### Multi-Window Burn Rate Alerts

```yaml
# PrometheusRule: multi-window burn rate alerts (Google SRE Workbook pattern)

# Slow burn: catches low-grade degradations that exhaust budget over days

## Error Budget Policy

An error budget policy defines how the organization responds when the budget is healthy or exhausted.

```markdown
## Error Budget Policy: Order API

**SLO:** 99.9% availability, 30-day rolling window
**Error budget:** 43 min 48 sec per month

### When budget is > 50% remaining
- Normal development velocity
- Feature deployments proceed per standard process
- On-call load is acceptable — proceed with planned work

### When budget is 25–50% remaining
- Reliability review required before new feature deployments
- Increase deployment monitoring duration from 5 min to 15 min
- Weekly error budget report shared with engineering leadership

### When budget is 10–25% remaining
- Feature freeze — no new features deployed until budget recovers
- Dedicated reliability sprint: fix top error sources
- Daily standups focused on reliability work
- Incident review for any new errors

### When budget is < 10% remaining (or exhausted)
- Feature work halted — all hands on reliability
- On-call engineer empowered to roll back any recent change without approval
- Escalate to engineering director
- Postmortem required for all incidents
- Deploy frequency reduced to once per week maximum

### Budget recovery
- Budget resets on a rolling 30-day basis
- Once budget recovers to > 50%, return to normal velocity
```
