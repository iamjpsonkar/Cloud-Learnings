# Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

SRE applies software engineering discipline to operations. It defines reliability targets, measures compliance, and uses automation to eliminate repetitive work — all to keep services reliable while enabling teams to move fast.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SLIs / SLOs / SLAs** | Define and measure reliability targets objectively |
| **Error budgets** | Balance reliability with velocity — 100% uptime is the wrong goal |
| **Toil reduction** | Automate repetitive operational work |
| **Blameless culture** | Postmortems focus on systems, not people |
| **Capacity planning** | Proactive, not reactive, resource management |
| **Progressive delivery** | Canary releases, feature flags — reduce blast radius |

## SRE vs DevOps

| Aspect | DevOps | SRE |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Focus | Culture + process | Reliability engineering |
| Target | Fast, reliable delivery | Defined reliability with error budgets |
| Toil | Reduce gradually | Explicit cap: 50% ops / 50% engineering |
| Incidents | Resolve and move on | Blameless postmortem + action items |
| Origin | Community movement | Google's answer to "who runs prod?" |
