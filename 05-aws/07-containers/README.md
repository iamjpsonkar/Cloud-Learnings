# AWS Containers

AWS offers managed container services at every layer of the stack: a fully managed registry (ECR), an orchestrator without Kubernetes (ECS), and a managed Kubernetes control plane (EKS).

---

## Container Service Selection

```
Do you want to manage Kubernetes?
├── No  → ECS (simpler ops; Fargate for serverless containers)
└── Yes → EKS (managed Kubernetes; bring your own node groups or use Fargate profiles)

Do you need a private container registry?
└── ECR (integrated with ECS/EKS/CodePipeline, immutable tags, vulnerability scanning)
```
