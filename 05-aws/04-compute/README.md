# AWS Compute

EC2 is the foundation of AWS compute: virtual machines you fully control. This section covers everything from launching instances to building auto-scaling fleets with load balancers, and running serverless functions with Lambda.

## Compute Decision Tree

```
Need compute?
├── Always-on, stateful, or requires specific OS?
│   └── EC2 (with ASG + ALB for scale)
├── Containerized workload?
│   └── ECS Fargate or EKS (see 07-containers/)
├── Event-driven, short-lived, stateless?
│   └── Lambda (see lambda.md)
└── Batch/HPC workload?
    └── AWS Batch or EC2 Spot fleet
```

## Minimum Competency Checklist

- [ ] Launch an EC2 instance with a custom AMI in a private subnet
- [ ] Create a launch template with user data for bootstrap automation
- [ ] Build a custom AMI from a running instance
- [ ] Configure an Auto Scaling Group with min/max/desired capacity
- [ ] Set scaling policies (target tracking, step, scheduled)
- [ ] Attach an ALB to an ASG and verify health checks
- [ ] Deploy a Lambda function with an IAM execution role
- [ ] Configure a Lambda trigger (API Gateway, SQS, EventBridge)
- [ ] Tune Lambda memory and understand the price/performance trade-off
