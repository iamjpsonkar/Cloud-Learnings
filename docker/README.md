# Cloud-Learnings Lab Platform

A complete self-contained Docker-based practice platform for learning AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, observability, security, CI/CD, and more — all locally, for free.

## What Is This?

This `docker/` directory contains everything needed to practice cloud concepts without paying for cloud accounts. It uses Docker Compose profiles to let you start only what you need.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd docker
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh setup       # Create .env from .env.example
./run.sh doctor      # Check prerequisites
./run.sh start core  # Start lightweight core services
./run.sh urls        # Show all service URLs
```

## Common Commands

```bash
./run.sh start              # Start core profile
./run.sh start aws          # Start core + AWS emulator
./run.sh start cloud        # Start core + all cloud emulators
./run.sh start observability
./run.sh start all          # Start everything (needs 16GB+ RAM)

./run.sh stop               # Stop all containers
./run.sh status             # Show running containers
./run.sh logs               # Tail all logs
./run.sh urls               # Print all service URLs
./run.sh open               # Open dashboard in browser

./run.sh lab list           # List available labs
./run.sh lab start aws-001  # Start a specific lab
./run.sh lab validate aws-001

./run.sh clean              # Remove containers/volumes (with confirmation)
./run.sh nuke               # Full cleanup (with confirmation)
./run.sh doctor             # Check prerequisites and system health
```

## Requirements

See [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for system requirements.

## Ports

See [PORTS.md](PORTS.md) for a full port mapping table.

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for network and service architecture.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for credential and security guidance.

**All credentials in `.env.example` are fake and local-only. Never use real cloud credentials here.**

## Cost Safety

See [COST-SAFETY.md](COST-SAFETY.md). Default mode costs nothing. Real cloud integrations may cost money.

## Documentation

See [docs/](docs/) for deep-dive guides:
- [How the platform works](docs/how-the-platform-works.md)
- [Docker Compose profiles](docs/docker-compose-profiles.md)
- [Local cloud emulators](docs/local-cloud-emulators.md)

- [Troubleshooting playbook](docs/troubleshooting-playbook.md)
- [Real cloud extensions](docs/real-cloud-extensions.md)

## Windows Users

Windows is supported via WSL2. Run everything inside a WSL2 Ubuntu terminal with Docker Desktop (WSL2 backend enabled).
