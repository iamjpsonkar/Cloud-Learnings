# Labs

Guided labs with tasks, commands, expected output, validation, troubleshooting, and solutions.

## How Labs Work

Each lab directory contains 7 files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Lab introduction, objectives, prerequisites |
| `tasks.md` | Step-by-step tasks to complete |
| `commands.md` | Command reference for this lab |
| `expected-output.md` | Screenshots/text of what success looks like |
| `validate.md` | How to verify your work |
| `troubleshooting.md` | Common issues in this lab |
| `solution.md` | Full solution (try yourself first!) |

## Running Labs

```bash
# List all labs
./run.sh lab list

# Start a lab
./run.sh lab start aws-localstack

# Validate your work
./run.sh lab validate aws-localstack

# Reset to clean state
./run.sh lab reset aws-localstack
```
