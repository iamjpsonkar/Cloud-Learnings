## Content Standards

### Accuracy

- Only document behavior you have verified, either from official documentation or hands-on testing.
- If something is uncertain, say so explicitly: "verify this against your configuration."
- Do not invent API names, command flags, or service behavior.

### Depth

Each doc should include where applicable:

1. What the service/concept is (plain explanation)
2. Why it exists / what problem it solves
3. Core components or architecture
4. Key configuration options or parameters
5. Common use cases with examples
6. Pricing model (for cloud services)
7. Comparison with similar services
8. AWS CLI / SDK / Terraform examples
9. Common gotchas and troubleshooting
10. References to official documentation

### File Naming

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Folders | `lowercase-kebab-case` with numeric prefix | `05-aws/` |
| Docs | `lowercase-kebab-case.md` | `ec2.md`, `vpc-peering.md` |
| Images | `{service}-{concept}.png` or `.svg` | `s3-storage-class.png` |
| Mermaid | `{concept}.mmd` | `aws-vpc-architecture.mmd` |
| Scripts | `verb-noun.sh` | `validate-repo.sh` |

## Image and Diagram Guidelines

- Place images in `assets/images/{provider}/{service}/`
- Prefer SVG for diagrams, PNG for screenshots
- Maximum image size: 500KB
- Every image must have a descriptive `alt` attribute
- New diagrams: create Mermaid source in `assets/diagrams/mermaid/` first
- If you use an image from an external source, add it to `assets/ATTRIBUTIONS.md`
- Do not embed external image URLs in Markdown

## Pull Request Process

2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/topic-name`

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commit style:
