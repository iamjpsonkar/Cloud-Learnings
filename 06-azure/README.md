## Azure Fundamentals

### Global Infrastructure

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Region** | Geographic area with one or more datacenters (e.g., East US, West Europe) |
| **Region pair** | Two regions paired for disaster recovery (e.g., East US ↔ West US) |
| **Availability Zone** | Physically separate datacenter within a region — 3 zones per region |
| **Geography** | Data-residency boundary (Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, etc.) |
| **Sovereign cloud** | Government-isolated regions: Azure Government, Azure China |

### Subscription Hierarchy

```
Tenant (Entra ID)
└── Root Management Group
    ├── Management Group (Production)
    │   ├── Subscription A (prod-workloads)
    │   └── Subscription B (prod-shared-services)
    └── Management Group (Development)
        └── Subscription C (dev-workloads)
```

### Pricing

- **Pay-as-you-go** — Billed per second/hour, no commitment
- **Reserved Instances** — 1-year or 3-year commitment, up to 72% savings
- **Azure Hybrid Benefit** — Use existing Windows Server/SQL Server licenses in Azure
- **Spot VMs** — Unused capacity at up to 90% discount (can be evicted)
