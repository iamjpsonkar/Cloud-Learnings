# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

GCP is Google's public cloud platform, differentiated by its global private fiber network, BigQuery analytics, Kubernetes origin (GKE), and AI/ML tooling (Vertex AI).

## GCP Resource Hierarchy

```
Organization (example.com)
└── Folders (optional — team / environment grouping)
    └── Projects (unit of billing, IAM, quotas)
        └── Resources (VMs, buckets, clusters, etc.)
```

- **Organization**: root node — tied to a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity domain.
- **Folder**: optional grouping for departments or environments.
- **Project**: primary isolation boundary — every resource belongs to exactly one project. Billing and quotas are per-project.

IAM policies are **inherited downward** — a policy set at the Organization is inherited by all folders, projects, and resources within it.

## Global vs Regional vs Zonal Resources

| Scope | Examples |
|-------|---------|
| **Global** | Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud CDN, IAM, Cloud KMS |
| **Regional** | Cloud Storage (default), Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Artifact Registry |
| **Zonal** | Compute Engine VMs, Persistent Disks, GKE node pools |

GCP's global load balancer is a single anycast IP that routes traffic to the nearest healthy backend — no per-region ALB setup needed.

## Pricing Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **On-demand** | Pay per second (minimum 1 minute for Compute Engine) |
| **Sustained Use Discounts (SUD)** | Automatic discounts (up to 30%) for VMs running >25% of the month — no commitment needed |
| **Committed Use Discounts (CUD)** | 1- or 3-year commitment — up to 57% discount (general-purpose) or 70% (memory-optimized) |
| **Spot VMs** | Interruptible VMs — up to 91% discount; preempted with 30s notice |
| **Free Tier** | Always-free products (e.g., 1 f1-micro VM/month, 5 GB Cloud Storage) |
