## Notes on Equivalence

These mappings are approximate. Services with the same name often have different capabilities, pricing models, and integration patterns.

- **DynamoDB ≠ Cosmos DB**: Cosmos DB offers multiple consistency models and APIs; DynamoDB has a simpler model with stronger operational guarantees.
- **Lambda ≠ Azure Functions**: Lambda is more mature with a larger ecosystem of triggers; Azure Functions has tighter Azure service integration.
- **EKS ≠ AKS ≠ GKE**: GKE is generally considered the most feature-complete managed Kubernetes. EKS has the largest AWS ecosystem. AKS has tighter Azure AD integration.
- **GCP subnets are regional**: Unlike AWS subnets (AZ-scoped), GCP subnets span all zones in a region.
- **Azure VNets are regional**: Azure subnets are within a VNet and can span availability zones (zones are a subset of a region in Azure, different from AWS AZs).
