# Projects

Hands-on projects tie together everything from the previous sections. Each project is self-contained: it starts from scratch, builds something real, and ends with a working deployment. Work through them in order or pick the ones most relevant to your role.

## How to Use These Projects

1. **Read the architecture diagram** — understand what you're building before writing any code
2. **Follow the numbered steps** — each step builds on the previous
3. **Use the cost estimate** — all projects include an estimated monthly cost
4. **Clean up when done** — each project ends with a teardown section

---

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with administrative access (or scoped IAM permissions per project)
- AWS CLI v2 configured (`aws configure`)
- Terraform >= 1.6
- Docker Desktop (for container projects)
- `kubectl` (for Kubernetes project)
- Basic familiarity with the relevant sections in this repo
