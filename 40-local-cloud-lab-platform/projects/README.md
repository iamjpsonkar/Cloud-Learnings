# Projects

Multi-service projects that combine multiple platform skills into end-to-end scenarios.
Unlike labs (which focus on one skill), projects build a complete system.

## Available Projects

| Project | Skills | Profiles |
|---------|--------|---------|
| [E-Commerce Platform](01-ecommerce/) | Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Traefik | core, data |
| [Microservices on Kubernetes](02-k8s-microservices/) | Kubernetes, Helm, GitOps | kubernetes, cicd |
