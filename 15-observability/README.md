# Observability

Observability is the ability to understand a system's internal state from its external outputs. The three pillars are metrics, logs, and traces — together they answer "is it broken, where is it broken, and why?"

---

## The Three Pillars

| Pillar | What it answers | Tools |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Metrics** | Is the system healthy? What are the numbers? | Prometheus, CloudWatch, Datadog |
| **Logs** | What happened? What was the error message? | Loki, ELK, CloudWatch Logs, GCP Logging |
| **Traces** | Where did this request spend its time? | Jaeger, Tempo, AWS X-Ray, GCP Trace |

**Combine all three**: an alert on a metric leads you to the relevant logs, and a trace ID in the log links to the distributed trace.

## Key Concepts

### RED Method (for services)
- **R**ate — requests per second
- **E**rrors — error rate (%)
- **D**uration — latency (p50, p95, p99)

### USE Method (for resources)
- **U**tilization — % time resource is busy
- **S**aturation — queue depth / waiting work
- **E**rrors — error events

### Four Golden Signals (Google SRE)
- Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation
