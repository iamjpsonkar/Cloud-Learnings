# FinOps

FinOps (Financial Operations) is the practice of bringing financial accountability to cloud spending. It aligns engineering, finance, and business teams around cost visibility, optimization, and informed trade-offs.

## FinOps Lifecycle

```
Inform → Optimize → Operate
  │           │          │
Cost       Rightsize   Budgets
tagging    Reserved    Anomaly
Dashboards Instances   detection
Showback   Spot usage  Unit econ.
```

## Core Principles

1. **Teams need cost visibility** — engineers can't optimize what they can't see
2. **Everyone is responsible** — cost is a shared metric, not just finance's problem
3. **Centralize practice, decentralize decisions** — central platform, team-level ownership
4. **Trade-offs are business decisions** — sometimes spending more is the right choice
5. **Unit economics over total cost** — cost-per-order matters more than total EC2 spend
