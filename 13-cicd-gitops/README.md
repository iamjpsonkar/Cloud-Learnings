# CI/CD & GitOps

CI/CD automates the path from code commit to production. GitOps extends that model by using Git as the single source of truth for both application code and infrastructure state.

---

## CI vs CD

| | Continuous Integration (CI) | Continuous Delivery (CD) | Continuous Deployment |
|--|--|--|--|
| What | Build, test, lint on every commit | Package and stage every green build | Auto-deploy every green build to production |
| Gate | Automated tests | Human approval (or none) | No human gate |
| Goal | Catch bugs early | Keep deployable artifact ready | Maximize deployment frequency |

## GitOps Principles

1. **Declarative** — all system state described as code in Git
2. **Versioned and immutable** — Git history is the audit log
3. **Pulled automatically** — agents pull from Git (not pushed by CI)
4. **Continuously reconciled** — agents detect and fix drift

```
Developer → git push → CI (build/test/push image) → Git repo update
                                                          │
                                              GitOps agent (ArgoCD/Flux)
                                                          │
                                                       Cluster
```
