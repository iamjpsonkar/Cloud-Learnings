# Networking for Cloud Engineers

A solid understanding of networking is essential for cloud work. Every VPC, security group, load balancer, and DNS record is a networking concept. This section covers the fundamentals — from the OSI model through to Zero Trust — with cloud-specific applications throughout.

## Minimum Competency

Before moving to cloud networking (VPCs, security groups, Route 53), be confident with:

- [ ] What happens at each OSI layer when you open `https://example.com`
- [ ] Difference between TCP and UDP, and which protocols use which
- [ ] How DNS resolution works (recursive resolver → root → TLD → authoritative)
- [ ] Common DNS record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, NS, SOA, PTR
- [ ] CIDR notation: what `/16`, `/24`, `/28` mean; how to calculate host count
- [ ] Private IP ranges (RFC 1918): 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16
- [ ] What NAT does and why it is necessary in cloud architectures
- [ ] Difference between a stateful firewall and a stateless ACL
- [ ] How TLS certificates work (CA chain, SNI, certificate validation)
- [ ] What a load balancer does at L4 vs L7

## OSI Quick Reference

```
Layer 7 — Application   HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SSH, SMTP, FTP
Layer 6 — Presentation  TLS/SSL, encoding, compression
Layer 5 — Session       Session establishment, TLS session resumption
Layer 4 — Transport     TCP, UDP — ports, reliability, flow control
Layer 3 — Network       IP, ICMP, routing — logical addressing
Layer 2 — Data Link     Ethernet, MAC addresses, VLANs, ARP
Layer 1 — Physical      Cables, fibre, radio, voltage levels
```
